I'm excited to share our ongoing work on VectraFlow, a novel data-flow system that bridges the gap between traditional database systems and modern AI capabilities. As AI continues to transform the technology landscape, we recognized the need for a system that could seamlessly integrate ML models with data processing pipelines.

Why VectraFlow?
------
Traditional database systems excel at structured data processing but struggle with unstructured data and AI operations. Meanwhile, AI systems often lack the robust data management capabilities of databases. VectraFlow addresses this divide by extending the relational model with advanced semantic operations powered by vectors, LLM prompts, and ML models.

Key Features
------
* **Unified Execution Model**: Supports both real-time streaming and batch processing
* **Advanced Semantic Operations**: Seamlessly integrates ML models with data processing
* **Reliability & Security**: Built-in guardrails and access control mechanisms
* **Multi-modal Support**: Handles diverse data types and AI-driven applications

Real-World Applications
------
VectraFlow enables several exciting applications:
* Real-time copyright infringement detection
* Continuous and agentic prompts
* Event detection in live video streams
* Semantic search and analysis

Looking Forward
------
We're continuing to enhance VectraFlow with new features and optimizations. Our upcoming talk at NEDB DAY 2025 will showcase the latest developments and include a live demo of the system.

Stay tuned for more updates on this exciting project!
