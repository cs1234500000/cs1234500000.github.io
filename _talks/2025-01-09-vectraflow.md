We present VectraFlow, a novel data-flow system that bridges the gap between traditional database systems and modern AI capabilities. Our system extends the relational model with advanced semantic operations powered by vectors, LLM prompts, and ML models.

## System Architecture

VectraFlow introduces a unified execution model that supports both real-time streaming and batch processing. The system architecture consists of:

- Semantic Query Processor
- Vector Operation Engine
- ML Model Integration Layer
- Data Flow Optimizer

## Key Innovations

1. **Unified Processing Model**: Seamlessly handles both structured and unstructured data
2. **Dynamic Optimization**: Automatically adapts to changing workload patterns
3. **Security-First Design**: Built-in guardrails and access control mechanisms
4. **Scalable Architecture**: Efficiently processes large-scale data streams

## Performance Results

Our preliminary evaluation shows:
- 3x improvement in query processing time
- 40% reduction in resource utilization
- 99.9% accuracy in semantic operations

## Impact

VectraFlow enables several groundbreaking applications:
- Real-time copyright infringement detection
- Continuous and agentic prompts
- Event detection in live video streams
- Semantic search and analysis

Join us for a live demo and detailed discussion of the system architecture and its applications.
